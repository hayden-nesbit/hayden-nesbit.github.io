                <h2>1. What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?</h2>
                    <p>Pseudo code is very helpful. Its use of fuller language reminds me of formulas in spreadsheets--where I’ve had most of my experience. The language itself seems very logical which is helpful for me. The high-level, descriptive nature of pseudo code is helpful for me as I come at programming as a beginner; having a tool like this to layout big-picture components with easy to understand comments will be a huge help!</p>
                <h2>2. What are you struggling with?</h2>
                    <p>It’s less of a specific struggle and more like walking around in the dark--I spent a good bit of time looking at code for certain features, manipulating it, seeing what changed and what didn’t, and trying to understand everything. This poking around feels a little like a “struggle” but it’s also leading to some helpful discoveries and, I hope, a better working grasp on the overall process.</p>
                <h2>3. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h2>
                    <p>After playing around with this blog for a day or so, experimenting with fixed navigation bars, margin,  gradient colors, etc., I’m eager to become more familiar with the capabilities of CSS. Specifically, I’m excited to learn more about the box model and how it can be used to incorporate features like drop down navigation bars and aside content. Wading into CSS this past week has increased my interest in and awareness of all the websites I frequent--I’m gaining a better eye for good design and usability!</p>
