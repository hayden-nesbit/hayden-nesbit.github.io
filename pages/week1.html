                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <h2>1. What did you learn about that helped you understand more about design?</h2>
                <p>The design acronym (C.R.A.P.) about contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity was really helpful. Being married to a graphic designer I often get a lot of help in the way things I create should look, but this overview helped me understand better for myself. I especially resonated with the contrast piece. I tend to think about contrast only in terms of color; using contrast in other ways--fonts, shapes, etc.--was a new way to think about good design. </p>
                <h2>2. What do you want to continue learning about that helps you understand design better?</h2>
                <p>Two things piqued my interest from our lesson on design: 1) the difference between geometric and visual center, and 2) how to guide the eye using design. These two things are incredibly important in good design, as they take into account not only what I think looks good, but how others experience the design.</p>
                <h2>3. What Design aspects are important to you as a user and as a developer?</h2>
                <p>Personally, both alignment and proximity are important to me--both as a user and developer. I find these two things are some of the most noticeable things to the eye. Even if one doesn’t have the vocabulary to explain them, I think most have an intuition for things being misaligned and poorly spaced. </p>
                <h2>4. What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h2>
                <p>This week was actually fairly straight forward and fun. Bootstrap is great and I spent a lot of time using templates, playing around, extending, and implementing ideas. This approach helped me get familiar with a lot of Bootstraps elements and how they work. However, I think I was “held back” in the sense that I may have benefitted in the long run more had I started from scratch. </p>
                <h2>5. What is one thing you would like to get better at in bootcamp?</h2>
                <p>I think it’s going to be important for me personally to not have perfection as my goal, but rather progress. I prefer things neat, clean, and finished. But I also value learning and know that the learning process is seldom neat or clean, and never finished. </p>
