        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <h2>1. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content
          and providing user experience?</h2>
        <p>I really like how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together. It makes conceptual sense to me, and the little
          bit I’ve grasped thus far has enabled me to do some pretty cool things with my blog (the dropdown navbar and
          footer icons in particular). I’m a little concerned about my ability to keep all the sheets “clean”--creating
          various classes to make all the features move how I want seems to get out of hand at times--but I’m sure that
          will come with time!
          <br>
          <br>
          In terms of the three tools’ ability to provide user experience, I’m excited to keep learning. JavaScript in
          particular seems to be a really powerful tool with endless possibilities for functionality and user
          experience.
        </p>
        <h2>2. What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</h2>
        <p>
          So far, my blog incorporates various objects to improve user experience. The main object being the navigation
          bar. It’s HTML and CSS code enable it to change color on click and hover, as well as incorporate dropdown
          sections under “Projects” and “Blog”. Also, the blog features a footer which contains two icons linked to my
          personal LinkedIn profile and Twitter page. In the future, I hope to implement JavaScript to loop through text
          on the home page (“Learning HTML”, “Learning CSS”, “Learning JavaScript”, etc.).
