            <h2>1. What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?</h2>
            <p>Pseudo code is very helpful. Its use of fuller language reminds me of formulas in spreadsheets--where
                I’ve had most of my experience. The language itself seems very logical which is helpful for me. The
                high-level, descriptive nature of pseudo code is helpful for me as I come at programming as a
                beginner; having a tool like this to layout big-picture components with easy to understand comments
                will be a huge help!</p>
            <h2>2. What are you struggling with?</h2>
            <p>It’s less of a specific struggle and more like walking around in the dark--I spent a good bit of time
                looking at code for certain features, manipulating it, seeing what changed and what didn’t, and
                trying to understand everything. This poking around feels a little like a “struggle” but it’s also
                leading to some helpful discoveries and, I hope, a better working grasp on the overall process.</p>
            <h2>3. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h2>
            <p>After playing around with this blog for a day or so, experimenting with fixed navigation bars,
                margin, gradient colors, etc., I’m eager to become more familiar with the capabilities of CSS.
                Specifically, I’m excited to learn more about the box model and how it can be used to incorporate
                features like drop down navigation bars and aside content. Wading into CSS this past week has
                increased my interest in and awareness of all the websites I frequent--I’m gaining a better eye for
                good design and usability!</p>

            <h2>1. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering
                content
                and providing user experience?</h2>
            <p>I really like how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together. It makes conceptual sense to me, and the
                little
                bit I’ve grasped thus far has enabled me to do some pretty cool things with my blog (the dropdown navbar
                and
                footer icons in particular). I’m a little concerned about my ability to keep all the sheets
                “clean”--creating
                various classes to make all the features move how I want seems to get out of hand at times--but I’m sure
                that
                will come with time!
                <br>
                <br>
                In terms of the three tools’ ability to provide user experience, I’m excited to keep learning.
                JavaScript in
                particular seems to be a really powerful tool with endless possibilities for functionality and user
                experience.

            <h2>2. What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</h2>
            <p>
                So far, my blog incorporates various objects to improve user experience. The main object being the
                navigation
                bar. It’s HTML and CSS code enable it to change color on click and hover, as well as incorporate
                dropdown
                sections under “Projects” and “Blog”. Also, the blog features a footer which contains two icons linked
                to my
                personal LinkedIn profile and Twitter page. In the future, I hope to implement JavaScript to loop
                through text
                on the home page (“Learning HTML”, “Learning CSS”, “Learning JavaScript”, etc.).

            <h2>1. What did you learn about that helped you understand more about design?</h2>
            <p>The design acronym (C.R.A.P.) about contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity was really helpful.
                Being married to a graphic designer I often get a lot of help in the way things I create should look,
                but this overview helped me understand better for myself. I especially resonated with the contrast
                piece. I tend to think about contrast only in terms of color; using contrast in other ways--fonts,
                shapes, etc.--was a new way to think about good design. </p>
            <h2>2. What do you want to continue learning about that helps you understand design better?</h2>
            <p>Two things piqued my interest from our lesson on design: 1) the difference between geometric and visual
                center, and 2) how to guide the eye using design. These two things are incredibly important in good
                design, as they take into account not only what I think looks good, but how others experience the
                design.</p>
            <h2>3. What Design aspects are important to you as a user and as a developer?</h2>
            <p>Personally, both alignment and proximity are important to me--both as a user and developer. I find these
                two things are some of the most noticeable things to the eye. Even if one doesn’t have the vocabulary to
                explain them, I think most have an intuition for things being misaligned and poorly spaced. </p>
            <h2>4. What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h2>
            <p>This week was actually fairly straight forward and fun. Bootstrap is great and I spent a lot of time
                using templates, playing around, extending, and implementing ideas. This approach helped me get familiar
                with a lot of Bootstraps elements and how they work. However, I think I was “held back” in the sense
                that I may have benefitted in the long run more had I started from scratch. </p>
            <h2>5. What is one thing you would like to get better at in bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>I think it’s going to be important for me personally to not have perfection as my goal, but rather
                progress. I prefer things neat, clean, and finished. But I also value learning and know that the
                learning process is seldom neat or clean, and never finished. </p>
