              <h2>1. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h2>
                  <p>Week one flew by--but was not without moments that felt painfully long (fumbling through Git, navigating the Command Line, etc.). I expected to struggle, and to feel a little overwhelmed, but wasn't sure <i>how</i> I would struggle. That's where I've been living: swimming in questions I didn't know I needed to ask!</p>
              <h2>2. What are you struggling with?</h2>
                  <p>In some sense I feel like everything's a struggle (re: swimming in questions!). But specifically, I'm still tiptoeing my way around GitHub, poking around in the Command Line, and crossing my fingers that repo's magically appear!</p>
              <h2>3. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h2>
                  <p>With the Command Line feeling a little more like home each day, I'm excited to continue uncovering its power. Beyond the CL, I'm eager to jump into html--the little bit I've picked up thus far has me itching to dive in deeper! (Specifically, how to make this text not run the length of the page!) </p>
